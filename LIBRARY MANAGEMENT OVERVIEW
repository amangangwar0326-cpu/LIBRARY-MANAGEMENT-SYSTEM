Summary 
Project Overview 
The Library Management System is a console-based C program designed to help 
manage books in a library. 
It performs essential operations such as adding, viewing, searching, modifying, 
deleting, issuing, and returning books, and stores all data permanently in binary files. 
This project demonstrates file handling, structures, user input validation, and menu
driven programming in C. 
Objectives 
To automate library record management. 
To efficiently track books, issues, and returns. 
To demonstrate practical use of file I/O and data structures in C. 
To provide a learning-level example of a real-world management system. 
Technical Details 
Aspect 
Description 
Language Used 
Compiler 
C Programming 
GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) 
Type Console Application 
Data Storage Binary files (books.dat, issues.dat) 
Structures Used 
Book, Issue 
Programming Concepts Used 
File handling, Structures, Loops, Conditional 
statements, Functions, Switch-case menu 
Data Structures 
1. Book Structure 
typedef struct { 
int id;                
char title[100]; 
char author[100]; 
char publisher[100]; 
int quantity;          
} Book; 
Stores information about each book: 
id → Unique identifier 
title, author, publisher → Text info 
quantity → Number of available copies 
2. Issue Structure 
typedef struct { 
int book_id;                  
char student_name[100]; 
char issue_date[20];          
} Issue; 
Tracks issued books: 
Which book ID was issued 
To which student 
On what date 
Core Functionalities

Function 
Add Book 
Purpose 
Add a new book record to books.dat. 
Display All Books 
3 
View all stored books in a table format. 
Search by ID Search a specific book using its ID.

Search by Title 
Search books by name or partial text. 
Modify Book Edit book details (title, author, publisher, quantity). 
Delete Book Remove a book permanently from the file. 
Issue Book Issue a book to a student and reduce its quantity. 
Return Book Return a book, increase its quantity, and remove issue record. 
Exit 
Files Used 
File Name 
books.dat 
issues.dat 
Quit the system safely. 
Purpose 
Stores all book details (binary format). 
Stores records of issued books. 
These files ensure data persistence — meaning data remains saved even after the 
program is closed. 
Important Utility Functions 
Function 
Description 
clear_stdin() Clears leftover input to avoid invalid reads. 
pause_and_clear() Pauses program for user to read output. 
removeNewline() 
Removes newline from fgets() input. 
bookExists() Checks if a book exists by ID. 
updateBookRecord() Updates a specific book record in the file. 
Compilation & Execution 
Save the File 
code.c 
Compile 
gcc code.c -o code 
Run 
./code       
# Linux / Mac 
code.exe     # Windows 
Sample Workflow 
Add a book → e.g. ID=101, Title="C Programming" 
Display all books → confirm it’s added 
Issue the book → enter student name & date 
Return the book → restores quantity 
 
Exit program → data remains stored in .dat files 
 
         Key C Concepts Demonstrated 
 
    Structures 
    File I/O (binary read/write) 
    Menu-driven switch case 
    Function modularity 
    Data persistence 
    Record update/delete logic 
 
      Advantages 
 
Simple and easy to understand 
 
Demonstrates real-world file-based record management 
 
Works on any OS (Windows, Linux, Mac) 
 
No database needed — uses .dat files for storage 
 
      Possible Enhancements 
 
Add student database with unique IDs 
 
Include due dates and fine calculation 
Implement login for admin/librarian 
Add color/clear-screen for better UI 
Convert to GUI or web-based app later 
Conclusion 
The Library Management System in C is a beginner-to-intermediate level project that 
integrates data storage, file handling, and structured programming concepts. 
It effectively simulates a small-scale real-world library operation — a valuable practice 
for students learning C programming and file management.
